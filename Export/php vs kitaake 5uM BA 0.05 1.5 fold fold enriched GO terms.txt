GOID: GO:0003700
Term: DNA-binding transcription factor activity
Ontology: MF
Definition: A protein or a member of a complex that interacts
    selectively and non-covalently with a specific DNA sequence
    (sometimes referred to as a motif) within the regulatory
    region of a gene to modulate transcription. Regulatory regions
    include promoters (proximal and distal) and enhancers. Genes
    are transcriptional units, and include bacterial operons.
