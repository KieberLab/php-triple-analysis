GOID: GO:0020037

---------------------
GOID: GO:0000156
Term: phosphorelay response regulator activity
Ontology: MF
Definition: Responds to a phosphorelay sensor to initiate a change
    in cell state or activity. The activity of the response
    regulator is regulated by transfer of a phosphate from a
    histidine residue in the sensor, to an aspartate residue in
    the response regulator. Many but not all response regulators
    act as transcriptional regulators to elicit a response.
Synonym: two-component response regulator activity
---------------------
GOID: GO:0005215
Term: transporter activity
Ontology: MF
Definition: Enables the directed movement of substances (such as
    macromolecules, small molecules, ions) into, out of or within
    a cell, or between cells.
Synonym: carrier
Synonym: GO:0005478
Secondary: GO:0005478

GOID: GO:0006355
Term: regulation of transcription, DNA-templated
Ontology: BP
Definition: Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or
    extent of cellular DNA-templated transcription.

GOID: GO:0000160
Term: phosphorelay signal transduction system
Ontology: BP
Definition: A conserved series of molecular signals found in
    prokaryotes and eukaryotes; involves autophosphorylation of a
    histidine kinase and the transfer of the phosphate group to an
    aspartate that then acts as a phospho-donor to response
    regulator proteins.
Synonym: histidyl-aspartyl phosphorelay
Synonym: phosphorelay signal transduction system
---------------------
GOID: GO:0055085
Term: transmembrane transport
Ontology: BP
Definition: The process in which a solute is transported across a
    lipid bilayer, from one side of a membrane to the other.
Synonym: membrane transport
---------------------
GOID: GO:0009055
Term: electron transfer activity
Ontology: MF
Definition: Any molecular entity that serves as an electron
    acceptor and electron donor in an electron transport chain. An
    electron transport chain is a process in which a series of
    electron carriers operate together to transfer electrons from
    donors to any of several different terminal electron acceptors
    to generate a transmembrane electrochemical gradient.
Synonym: electron acceptor activity

GOID: GO:0008152
Term: metabolic process
Ontology: BP
Definition: The chemical reactions and pathways, including
    anabolism and catabolism, by which living organisms transform
    chemical substances. Metabolic processes typically transform
    small molecules, but also include macromolecular processes
    such as DNA repair and replication, and protein synthesis and
    degradation.
