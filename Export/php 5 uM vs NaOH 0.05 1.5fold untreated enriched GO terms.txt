GOID: GO:0008152
Term: metabolic process
Ontology: BP
Definition: The chemical reactions and pathways, including
    anabolism and catabolism, by which living organisms transform
    chemical substances. Metabolic processes typically transform
    small molecules, but also include macromolecular processes
    such as DNA repair and replication, and protein synthesis and
    degradation.

GOID: GO:0000156
Term: phosphorelay response regulator activity
Ontology: MF
Definition: Responds to a phosphorelay sensor to initiate a change
    in cell state or activity. The activity of the response
    regulator is regulated by transfer of a phosphate from a
    histidine residue in the sensor, to an aspartate residue in
    the response regulator. Many but not all response regulators
    act as transcriptional regulators to elicit a response.
Synonym: two-component response regulator activity
---------------------
GOID: GO:0000160
Term: phosphorelay signal transduction system
Ontology: BP
Definition: A conserved series of molecular signals found in
    prokaryotes and eukaryotes; involves autophosphorylation of a
    histidine kinase and the transfer of the phosphate group to an
    aspartate that then acts as a phospho-donor to response
    regulator proteins.
Synonym: histidyl-aspartyl phosphorelay
Synonym: phosphorelay signal transduction system
---------------------
GOID: GO:0003700
Term: DNA-binding transcription factor activity
Ontology: MF
Definition: A protein or a member of a complex that interacts
    selectively and non-covalently with a specific DNA sequence
    (sometimes referred to as a motif) within the regulatory
    region of a gene to modulate transcription. Regulatory regions
    include promoters (proximal and distal) and enhancers. Genes
    are transcriptional units, and include bacterial operons.
