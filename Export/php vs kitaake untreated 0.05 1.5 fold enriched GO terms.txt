GOID: GO:0003700
Term: DNA-binding transcription factor activity
Ontology: MF
Definition: A protein or a member of a complex that interacts
    selectively and non-covalently with a specific DNA sequence
    (sometimes referred to as a motif) within the regulatory
    region of a gene to modulate transcription. Regulatory regions
    include promoters (proximal and distal) and enhancers. Genes
    are transcriptional units, and include bacterial operons.
Synonym: DNA binding transcription factor activity
Synonym: gene-specific transcription factor activity
Synonym: nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity
Synonym: sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor
    activity

GOID: GO:0009690
Term: cytokinin metabolic process
Ontology: BP
Definition: The chemical reactions and pathways involving
    cytokinins, a class of adenine-derived compounds that can
    function in plants as growth regulators.
Synonym: cytokinin metabolism

GOID: GO:0019139
Term: cytokinin dehydrogenase activity
Ontology: MF
Definition: Catalysis of the reaction: N6-dimethylallyladenine +
    acceptor + H2O = adenine + 3-methylbut-2-enal + reduced
    electron acceptor.
Synonym: 6-N-dimethylallyladenine:acceptor oxidoreductase activity

GOID: GO:0020037
Term: heme binding
Ontology: MF
Definition: Interacting selectively and non-covalently with heme,
    any compound of iron complexed in a porphyrin (tetrapyrrole)
    ring.
Synonym: haem binding
---------------------
GOID: GO:0000160
Term: phosphorelay signal transduction system
Ontology: BP
Definition: A conserved series of molecular signals found in
    prokaryotes and eukaryotes; involves autophosphorylation of a
    histidine kinase and the transfer of the phosphate group to an
    aspartate that then acts as a phospho-donor to response
    regulator proteins.
Synonym: histidyl-aspartyl phosphorelay
Synonym: phosphorelay signal transduction system
